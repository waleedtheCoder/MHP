# 🧠 Mental Health Journal  
*A smart, AI-powered mental health journaling platform*

## 📌 Overview
**Mental Health Journal** is a personalized web application designed to help users track their emotional wellbeing, uncover hidden mental health patterns, and receive proactive, data-driven support.

Think of it as a **smart diary + mental health coach + safe anonymous community** — all in one place.

Unlike traditional journaling apps, this platform goes beyond writing. It analyzes entries, detects emotional cycles and triggers, predicts difficult days, and suggests coping strategies that have actually worked for the user before.
